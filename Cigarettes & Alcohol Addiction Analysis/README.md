Project: Cigarettes & Alcohol Addiction Analysis

Tools used: Excel, Power BI

As a beginner in data analysis, I explored a real-world dataset of 3,000 individuals to understand patterns in smoking and drinking behavior. I cleaned and organized the data using Excel, then built a full report in Power BI showing how addiction relates to factors like BMI, diet, exercise, sleep, and mental health.

I used different types of charts — including maps, scatter plots, and bar graphs — to show relationships and outliers. This project helped me practice working with large datasets, building calculated columns, and designing an interactive dashboard that communicates meaningful health insights clearly.
