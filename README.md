I am currently working with tools like Excel, Power BI and SQL to perform exploratory data analysis and gain valuable insights on real as well as made-up datasets, to create a stron CV. I am also a beginner and learning how to work with HTML, CSS and Javascript to build simplistic, responsive and well-designed websites. This repository includes all of my personal projects. I will keep building projects and uploading them here, as I keep implementing new concepts through my learning.
